User â†’ codegemma:latest:
code snippet in python to use the while loop, show me a sample.

codegemma:latest Response:
```python
# Initialize the counter variable
counter = 0

# Set the loop condition to continue until the counter reaches 10
while counter < 10:
    # Increment the counter variable
    counter += 1

    # Print the current value of the counter
    print(counter)
```

**Output:**

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

**Explanation:**

* The `while` loop is a conditional loop that continues to execute as long as the specified condition is true.
* In this case, the condition is `counter < 10`, which means the loop will continue until the counter reaches 10.
* Inside the loop, the counter variable is incremented by 1 using the `+=` operator.
* The `print()` function is used to display the current value of the counter.
* The loop continues until the counter reaches 10, at which point the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates.

**Additional Notes:**

* The `while` loop is a powerful tool for performing repetitive tasks.
* It is important to ensure that the loop condition eventually becomes false to prevent an infinite loop.
* The `break` statement can be used to exit the loop prematurely.
* The `continue` statement can be used to skip the current iteration of the loop.
